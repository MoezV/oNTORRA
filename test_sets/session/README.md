# oNTORRA session/

The session directory contains the .Rdata session file(s) with the appropriate test sets.
Note: Temporary variables are not removed from these session files in case the user wishes to see an example of their usage, but they are overwritten with the latest entries.

These files are meant to help the user compare their personal results to all the values ran in the development build if the user's is unable to run the oNTORRA script or want to verify the intermediate variables.
