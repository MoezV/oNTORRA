# oNTORRA data/ info
Note that bac3-1_nt-freq is the k=1 nucleotide counts ONLY in the sense direction (i.e. f(X)).

The other k-mer files (e.g. back3-k2-oligo-freq) is the nucleotide motif counts in BOTH the sense and antisense directions (e.g. f\*(XY), f\*(XYZ), f\*(XYZW))

The _bac-classes file is a tab-separated value (TSV) which contains the organism IDs along with the grouping values in each additional column, with each rightmost column being a broader category. In this example set, the organisms are grouped by their Genus followed by their Class
