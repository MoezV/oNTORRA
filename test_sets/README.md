# oNTORRA test sets
## 'bac'/'bac3' set (N=26)
A bacterial dataset to compare the dinucleotiode relative abundance (_&rho;_\*(XY)) values to the reported 50kb _&rho;_\*(XY) by [Burge et al., 1992 and Karlin et al., 1998](https://github.com/MoezV/oNTORRA/edit/main/README.md#recommended-literature).

The list of the RefSeq (Genome) accessions can be viewed through the README file within the `data/bac` directory.
